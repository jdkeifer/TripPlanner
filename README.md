# TripPlanner
Console UI proj. and Library proj. using .NET framework 4.8

This is my first full blown attempt to integrate some of the things I have learned with classes and yet provide some sort of a workable project.

THis is a trip planner for commercial drivers that will use average speed and fuel time to estimate the following things;

how long the trip will take
how many DOT required 30 min breaks for the trip
how many 10 hour sleeper breaks are required
how much time is DOT recordable
how much time will be left when the trip is completed
from trip start time, an ETA will be generated taking timezones, rest breaks, sleeper breaks and fuel stop time into consideration

The trip planner allows the average MPH and the fuel stop time to be changed for each iteration of the planner for "what if" scenarios

At the end of the run, a list will be generated and displayed and show what can and cannot be done based on inputs
